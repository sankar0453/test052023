        "\n",
        "1.   Encapsulation  \n",
        "        Encapuslation is the process of wrapping the data ata and related behavior (methods/functions) into objects. It helps to maintaine modularity of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   Abstraction  \n",
        "        Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. In OOP, classes and objects provide abstraction by representing real-world concepts as abstract data types. Abstraction enables developers to focus on essential features and ignore unnecessary details.\n",
        "2.   Inheritance  \n",
        "        Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes. It enables the reuse of code and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes. Through inheritance, derived classes inherit properties and behavior from base (parent) classes, promoting code reuse and enhancing modularity.\n",
        "2.   Polymoprphism  \n",
        "        Polymorphism means the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors. It allows different objects to respond differently to the same message or method call. Polymorphism simplifies code by enabling the use of generic programming constructs and promoting flexibility and extensibility.\n",
